# **PROJECT CITROUILLE**
Citrouille is a web application that facilitates the learning of word lists by primary school students. The application is based on the principle of magic dictation.A teacher publishes a list of words related to a picture and/or sound. When the student sees the picture/sound, he/she must write the word it represents without making mistakes.


## **Context**
This web application was written in PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It was a 6 weeks project, made to validate our L3 Informatique in the University of Rennes 1.

If you wish to access the code architecture of the project [here](DESIGN.md).

To install, see [this](INSTALL.md) document.

## **Main Features**

A guest:

	Search a list by name.

	Search a list by a word.

	Search a list by level.
